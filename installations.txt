Installation Guidelines

Before you can run Sahayatri, please follow the steps below to set up the necessary tools and dependencies.

Install Required Software:

Visual Studio Code: Download and install Visual Studio Code, a popular code editor, from the official website (https://code.visualstudio.com).
IntelliJ IDEA: Download and install IntelliJ IDEA, an integrated development environment (IDE) for Spring Boot, from the official website (https://www.jetbrains.com/idea).
JDK (Java Development Kit): Download and install JDK from the Oracle website (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/). [Specify the required JDK version if different from the provided URL.]
Emulator Setup:

Android Studio: Install Android Studio, which provides the Android emulator, from the official website (https://developer.android.com/studio).
Set up an Android Virtual Device (AVD) within Android Studio. [Specify the AVD details you mentioned, such as Pexels 32 API 22.]
Elasticsearch Installation:

Download Elasticsearch from the official website (https://www.elastic.co/downloads/enterprise-search). [Specify the Elasticsearch version if different from the provided URL.]

Locate the elasticsearch.bat file inside the \elasticsearch-[version]\bin folder.
Run the elasticsearch.bat file to start Elasticsearch on your machine.


Firebase Storage Configuration:

Create an account on Firebase (https://firebase.google.com) if you don't have one already.
Go to the Firebase console and create a new app specifically for storage.
Obtain the Firebase config, which includes the necessary credentials, and place it in your code to enable Firebase storage functionality.


OpenAI API Integration:

Create an account on OpenAI (https://openai.com) if you haven't already.
Obtain your API key from the OpenAI website.

In the Chatbot.js file of your React Native application, locate the apiKey variable and replace the existing value with your OpenAI API key.
Project Setup:

Open the downloaded folder of your React Native application in Visual Studio Code by right-clicking on the folder and selecting "Open with Visual Studio Code."
Similarly, open your Spring Boot application in IntelliJ IDEA by selecting "Open" and navigating to the project folder.
Install Dependencies:

In your React Native application, run yarn or npm install in the terminal to install the required dependencies. The dependencies will be automatically fetched based on the project's configuration files.
Make sure your Spring Boot application's dependencies are resolved by IntelliJ IDEA.
Running the Application:

To run the React Native application, use the command yarn android or npm run android in the terminal. This will build the app and launch it on the Android emulator.
To run the Spring Boot application, click the green play button in the top-right corner of IntelliJ IDEA. This will start the backend server.
Once both the backend and frontend are running, you can enjoy using Sahayatri by interacting with the application in the Android emulator.
